    "section": "",
    "text": "Preregistering animal experiments means publicly recording your study’s aims, design, and analysis plan before you begin. This simple step boosts transparency and reproducibility, helping reviewers identify unpublished or selective results and assess the risk of bias more reliably. It also prevents needless duplication, honouring the 3Rs by reducing animal use, and lays a stronger foundation for systematic reviews and meta-analyses. Ultimately, preregistration enhances the ethical and scientific rigour of preclinical research, improving its predictiveness for human studies."

    "text": "Transparent, high-quality experimental design in animal studies, underpinned by rigorous internal validity, allows systematic reviews to reliably summarise evidence. By detailing eligibility criteria, randomisation, blinding and sample size calculations up front, researchers minimise bias and ensure that reported effects genuinely reflect the interventions under study. This clarity enables systematic reviewers to assess study quality accurately, pool data with confidence and draw robust conclusions. Ultimately, well-designed, transparent experiments not only strengthen the scientific and ethical foundations of preclinical research but also improve its translational value."

Since then, the CAMARADES have broadened their scope to other disease models such as neuropathic pain, neuropsychiatric conditions and Alzheimer’s disease.\nThe CAMARADES has pioneered in the field of preclinical systematic review, and in addition to carrying out their own research, provide a supportive framework for other research groups performing systematic review."
