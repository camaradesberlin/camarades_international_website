Welcome to the website for the CAMARADES International Network! 

The CAMARADES research group comprises world-leading preclinical meta-research scientists who aim to bring evidence to translational medicine.

## Bringing evidence to translational medicine
The Collaborative Approach to Meta Analysis and Review of Animal Data from Experimental Studies (CAMARADES) research group was founded in 2004 by Malcolm Macleod and David Howells, aiming to address translational failures in preclinical stroke research using systematic review and meta-analysis. Since then, the CAMARADES have broadened their scope to other disease models such as neuropathic pain, neuropsychiatric conditions and Alzheimer's disease.

The CAMARADES has pioneered in the field of preclinical systematic review, and in addition to carrying out their own research, provide a supportive framework for other research groups performing systematic review.
